# google-homepage is an attempt at emulating the Google homepage using CSS and HTML. This assignment tested my ability to use the chrome developer tools for understanding HTML structure and CSS styling. In this challenge I tried to create as many elements as possible from scratch, to challenge myself and test my CSS skills. For example, I recreated the SVGs that are used in this project using Figma and experimented with using CSS filter to change the colours of the SVGs on hover. While it would have been easier to link to an external SVG or use existing ones, it was good to try and complete every element from scratch.
